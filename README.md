# hello-world
Mon premier repository
I'm a bit ashamed that I never used Git Before. 
But I am very proud to fight my fear and weakness and begin a new journey towards proper programming
I hope Git will allow me to improve my programming skills, and allow me to do collaborative work with other people.
